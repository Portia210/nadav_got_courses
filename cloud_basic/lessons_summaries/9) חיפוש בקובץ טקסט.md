## Searching in a Text File

The main topic of this article is searching for specific content within a text file in Linux using the `grep` command. The `grep` command is a powerful tool used to search for patterns within files. It is commonly used to filter lines that contain a specific string or pattern.

### Using `grep` Command

To search for lines containing the word "ERROR" in a file, you can use the following command:
```bash
grep "ERROR" /file_path_to_search
```

This command will display only the lines that contain the word "ERROR".

### Chaining Commands

In Linux, you can chain commands together by using the pipe (`|`) symbol. This allows you to pass the output of one command as input to another. For example:
```bash
grep "ERROR" /file_path_to_search | less
```
This command will display the filtered lines containing "ERROR" and show them in a paginated view using `less`.

You can further filter the output by chaining multiple `grep` commands:
```bash
grep "ERROR" /file_path_to_search | grep "another" | less
```

### Additional `grep` Options

- To perform a case-insensitive search, you can use the `-i` flag:
```bash
grep -i "searched" /file_path_to_search
```

- To display the number of lines that match a pattern, you can use the `-c` flag:
```bash
grep -c "pattern" /file_path_to_search
```

### Redirecting Output

You can redirect the output of a command to a new file using the `>` operator. For example, to save the search results to a new file:
```bash
grep "ERROR" /file_path_to_search > output.txt
```

### Counting Lines

To count the number of lines in a file, you can use the `wc` command with the `-l` flag:
```bash
wc -l /file_path_to_count
```

By combining these commands and options, you can efficiently search, filter, and manipulate text files in Linux using the `grep` command along with other related commands like `wc` and input/output redirection.
