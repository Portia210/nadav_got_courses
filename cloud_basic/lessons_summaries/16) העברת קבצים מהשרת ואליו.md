### Expanding on Secure Copy (SCP) Protocol

The article discusses the use of the SCP (Secure Copy) protocol for transferring files between servers. SCP is a command-line utility that allows secure file transfers between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It uses SSH (Secure Shell) for data transfer and provides encryption and authentication over an insecure network.

#### Linux Commands in the Article

The article provides examples of using the `scp` command:

1. **Copying from Local to Remote Server:**
   ```
   scp -i <path to pem> <input> username@[ip]:<output>
   ```
   - `-i <path to pem>`: Specifies the identity file (private key) for public key authentication.
   - `<input>`: Path to the file you want to transfer from the local machine.
   - `username@[ip]`: Username and IP address of the remote server.
   - `<output>`: Destination path on the remote server.

2. **Copying from Remote Server to Local:**
   ```
   scp -i <path to pem> username@[ip]:<input on ec2> <output on our machine>
   ```
   - `-i <path to pem>`: Specifies the identity file (private key) for public key authentication.
   - `username@[ip]`: Username and IP address of the remote server.
   - `<input on ec2>`: Path to the file on the remote server.
   - `<output on our machine>`: Destination path on the local machine.

#### Popular Usage and Options of SCP Command

- **Usage**:
  - Transferring files securely between local and remote servers.
  - Copying files between two remote servers.
  - Downloading files from a remote server to the local machine.
  - Uploading files from the local machine to a remote server.

- **Options**:
  - `-P <port>`: Specifies the port number to connect to on the remote host.
  - `-r`: Recursively copy entire directories.
  - `-v`: Verbose mode to show detailed information about the transfer.
  - `-C`: Enable compression during the transfer to reduce bandwidth usage.
  - `-q`: Quiet mode, suppress progress meter and non-error messages.

By understanding and utilizing the SCP protocol and its commands effectively, users can securely transfer files between Linux servers with ease.
