## Topic: Setting up EC2

The article discusses the process of setting up an EC2 instance. EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, which is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers on which they can run their applications.

### Overview of EC2
EC2 provides a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose computing, memory-intensive applications, and high-performance computing. Users can choose the instance type that best suits their needs and pay only for the compute capacity they use.

### Setting up an EC2 Instance
To set up an EC2 instance, users need to log in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 dashboard, and launch a new instance. During the instance creation process, users can choose the instance type, configure networking settings, and add storage volumes as needed.

### Common Options and Usage
- **Instance Types**: Users can choose from a variety of instance types, such as t2.micro, m5.large, and c5.xlarge, each offering different combinations of CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Networking**: Users can configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to their instances, as well as assign Elastic IP addresses for static public IPs.
- **Storage**: Users can attach EBS volumes to their instances to store data persistently, or use instance store volumes for temporary storage.

### Related Commands
- **aws ec2 describe-instances**: This command can be used to retrieve information about EC2 instances in the user's account. Common options include filtering instances by tags or instance IDs.
- **aws ec2 run-instances**: This command is used to launch new EC2 instances. Users can specify options such as instance type, AMI (Amazon Machine Image), and security groups.

By following the steps outlined in this article, users can successfully set up an EC2 instance on AWS and leverage the flexibility and scalability of cloud computing for their applications.
