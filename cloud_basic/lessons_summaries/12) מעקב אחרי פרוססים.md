The main topic of the article is about monitoring processes. It mentions some Linux commands related to processes:

1. **top**: Displays the most resource-consuming processes. To exit, press `q`.
   - **Usage**: `top`
   - **Options**: 
     - `-d [seconds]`: Specifies the delay between updates.
     - `-u [username]`: Displays processes for a specific user.
     - `-p [PID]`: Monitor specific PIDs.

2. **ps (process)**: Shows the processes running for the current user.
   - **Usage**: `ps`
   - **Options**: 
     - `aux`: Displays all running processes.
     - `-e`: Display all processes.
     - `-f`: Displays full-format listing.

3. **kill {pid}**: Terminates a process with the specified PID.
   - **Usage**: `kill [PID]`
   - **Options**: 
     - `-9`: Sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate a process.
     - `-15`: Sends a SIGTERM signal to gracefully terminate a process.

4. **echo $$**: Prints the PID of the current shell.
   - **Usage**: `echo $$`

When killing a process, there are several options (signals) available:
1. **SIGTERM (15)**: Asks the process to terminate.
2. **SIGKILL (9)**: Forces the process to terminate immediately.

By using these commands, users can effectively monitor and manage processes on a Linux system.
