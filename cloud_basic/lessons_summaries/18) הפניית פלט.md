### Article: Redirecting Output

The article discusses a useful trick in Linux for searching commands in the history using `ctrl + r`. It also explains how to redirect the output of a command to a different location instead of printing it on the screen.

When redirecting output in Linux, there are two main output channels:
1. **Standard Output (stdout)**
2. **Standard Error (stderr)**
3. **Status**: Returns a number indicating if the command executed successfully (0) or encountered an issue (non-zero).

To redirect the output to a file, you can use the `>` symbol. For example, `cat txt.txt > output` will redirect the output of the `cat` command to a file named `output`.

If you want to redirect errors to a file, you can use `2>`. For instance, `blablabla 2> error.txt` will redirect errors to the `error.txt` file.

To redirect both standard output and errors, you can combine the redirections like this: `blablabla > txt.txt 2 > error.txt`.

You can check the status of the last command executed by using `echo $?`.

### Linux Commands Expansion:

- **`date` Command**: This command is used to display the current date and time. It is commonly used in scripts to timestamp files or log events. The `date` command can also be used to set the system date and time.

- **`cat` Command**: The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files. It is often used to display the contents of a file, create new files, or combine multiple files into a single file.

- **`echo` Command**: The `echo` command is used to display a line of text or a variable value. It is frequently used in shell scripts to print messages or output variables.

By understanding how to redirect output in Linux and the popular commands mentioned in the article, users can efficiently manage command output and errors in their daily tasks.
