# Running Docker on EC2

## Basic Steps

### 1. Check Docker Version
First, verify if Docker is installed on your EC2 instance:
```bash
docker --version
```

### 2. Save Docker Image
If you have an image locally (for example, a Flask app), save it to a file:
```bash
# List your images first
docker images

# Save the image to a file
docker save -o <output_file.tar> <image_name>
```
Arguments explained:
- `<output_file.tar>`: The name of the tar file where the image will be saved (e.g., flask_app.tar)
- `<image_name>`: The name of your Docker image (e.g., flask_app)

### 3. Transfer to EC2
Use SCP to transfer the saved image to your EC2 instance:
```bash
scp -i <path_to_key.pem> <image_file.tar> <username>@<ec2_ip>:<destination_path>
```
Arguments explained:
- `<path_to_key.pem>`: Full path to your EC2 key file (e.g., /path/to/your-key.pem)
- `<image_file.tar>`: The tar file containing your Docker image (e.g., flask_app.tar)
- `<username>`: Your EC2 instance username (usually 'ubuntu' for Ubuntu instances)
- `<ec2_ip>`: Your EC2 instance's public IP address
- `<destination_path>`: Where to save the file on EC2 (e.g., ~/ for home directory)

### 4. Load and Run on EC2
After transferring, SSH into your EC2 instance and load the image:
```bash
# SSH into EC2
ssh -i <path_to_key.pem> <username>@<ec2_ip>

# Load the image
docker load -i <image_file.tar>
```
Arguments explained:
- `<path_to_key.pem>`: Full path to your EC2 key file
- `<username>`: Your EC2 instance username
- `<ec2_ip>`: Your EC2 instance's public IP address
- `<image_file.tar>`: The tar file containing your Docker image

## Explanation

1. **Saving Images**: The `docker save` command creates a tar archive of your Docker image. This is necessary because:
   - It allows you to transfer the image to another machine
   - It preserves all layers and configurations of your image
   - It's more efficient than transferring the image through Docker Hub

2. **SCP Transfer**: The `scp` command is used to securely copy files between machines:
   - `-i <path_to_key.pem>`: Specifies your EC2 key file for authentication
   - `<image_file.tar>`: The source file (your saved Docker image)
   - `<username>@<ec2_ip>:<destination_path>`: The destination on your EC2 instance

3. **Loading Images**: The `docker load` command:
   - Restores the image from the tar file
   - Makes it available for use on the EC2 instance
   - Preserves all the original image configurations

This process allows you to run your Docker containers on EC2 without needing to rebuild the images or use Docker Hub as an intermediary.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Docker on EC2
Create a script file named `install_docker.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

### 2. Make the script executable and run it
```bash
chmod +x install_docker.sh
./install_docker.sh
```

Note: If you're working on Windows, you might need to convert the script's line endings to Unix format (LF). You can use the `dos2unix` command:
```bash
dos2unix install_docker.sh
```

### 3. Verify Docker Installation
```bash
docker --version
```

## Working with Docker on EC2

### Running Containers
1. Pull and run a container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginxdemos/hello
```

2. Check running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```

### Managing Images
1. List all images:
```bash
docker images
```

2. Save an image to a file:
```bash
docker save -o my_image.tar image_name
```

3. Load an image from a file:
```bash
docker load -i my_image.tar
```

### Transferring Images
To transfer Docker images between your local machine and EC2:

1. Save the image locally:
```bash
docker save -o image_name.tar image_name
```

2. Use SCP to transfer the file:
```bash
scp -i your-key.pem image_name.tar ubuntu@your-ec2-ip:~/
```

3. Load the image on EC2:
```bash
docker load -i image_name.tar
```

### 5. Managing Running Containers
To stop a running container:
```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a specific container
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```
Arguments explained:
- `<container_id_or_name>`: The ID or name of the container you want to stop
  - You can find this using `docker ps`
  - Container ID is usually a long string like "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
  - Container name is what you specified with --name when running the container

Additional container management commands:
```bash
# Force stop a container (if normal stop doesn't work)
docker kill <container_id_or_name>

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm <container_id_or_name>

# Stop and remove in one command
docker rm -f <container_id_or_name>
```

## Best Practices
1. Always use specific port mappings when running containers
2. Use the `-d` flag for running containers in detached mode
3. Name your containers for easier management
4. Regularly clean up unused images and containers
5. Use Docker volumes for persistent data storage

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. Permission denied errors:
   - Add your user to the docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
   - Log out and log back in for changes to take effect

2. Port conflicts:
   - Check if the port is already in use: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN`
   - Choose a different port mapping if needed

3. Memory issues:
   - Monitor container resource usage: `docker stats`
   - Adjust container resource limits if necessary

## Detailed Steps for Installing and Running a Specific Image on EC2

### 1. Transfer the Image to EC2
Assuming you have your image file (e.g., `myapp.tar`) on your local machine:

```bash
# From your local machine, transfer the image to EC2
scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem myapp.tar ubuntu@your-ec2-ip:~/
```

### 2. SSH into Your EC2 Instance
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
```

### 3. Load the Image on EC2
```bash
# Load the image into Docker
docker load -i myapp.tar

# Verify the image was loaded
docker images
```

### 4. Run the Container
```bash
# Basic run command
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp myapp:latest

# More detailed run command with additional options
docker run -d \
  --name myapp \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v /host/path:/container/path \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  myapp:latest
```

### 5. Verify the Container is Running
```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps

# Check container logs
docker logs myapp

# Check container status
docker stats myapp
```

### 6. Managing the Container
```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop myapp

# Start the container
docker start myapp

# Restart the container
docker restart myapp

# Remove the container
docker rm -f myapp
```

### 7. Accessing the Application
- If running a web application, access it at: `http://your-ec2-ip:8080`
- Make sure your EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on port 8080

### 8. Troubleshooting
```bash
# View container logs
docker logs myapp

# View detailed container information
docker inspect myapp

# Access container shell
docker exec -it myapp /bin/bash

# Check container resource usage
docker stats myapp
```
