# Building a Docker Image with Flask

## Project Structure
```
my_flask_app/
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
```

## 1. Configuration File (config.py)
```python
class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-here'
```

## 2. Flask Application (app.py)
```python
from flask import Flask
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello from Docker!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## 3. Dependencies (requirements.txt)
```
flask==3.0.0
```

## 4. Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## 5. Building and Running
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-flask-app .
# docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> <build_context>
# -t: tag flag for naming the image
# <image_name>: name you want to give your image
# <tag>: version of your image (defaults to 'latest' if not specified)
# <build_context>: path to directory containing Dockerfile ('.' means current directory)

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
# docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
# -p: port mapping flag
# <host_port>: port on your machine
# <container_port>: port inside the container
# <image_name>: name of the image to run
```

## 6. Understanding the Output
When you run the container, you'll see:
```
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:5000
```

### URLs Explained:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000` - Use this from your host machine (your computer)
- `http://172.17.0.2:5000` - This is the container's internal IP
- `0.0.0.0` means the server is listening on all network interfaces

## 7. Production Setup
For production, use Gunicorn instead of Flask's development server:

1. Update requirements.txt:
```
flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

2. Update Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
# Replace the development server with Gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

## 8. Excluding Files
To exclude files from your Docker image (like build scripts), create a .dockerignore file:
```
# .dockerignore
build.sh
*.sh
.git
.gitignore
__pycache__
*.pyc
```

## Key Points
1. The Dockerfile defines how to build your image
2. Use .dockerignore to keep your image clean
3. For production, use Gunicorn instead of Flask's development server
4. Port mapping (-p) connects your host machine to the container
5. The build context (.) determines which files are available during build
