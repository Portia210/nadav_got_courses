# Viewing Container in EC2

## Accessing Your Container

### 1. Check Container Status
After your container is running, you can test it using curl:
```bash
curl <url_with_port_of_container>
```
This should work exactly like accessing it in a browser.

### 2. Access Through Browser
To access your container through a web browser:

1. Go to AWS Console
2. Navigate to your instance
3. Find the Public IPv4 address
4. Use this URL format: `http://<public_ipv4>:<port>`

### 3. Configure Security Group
If you can't access the container, you need to configure the EC2 security group:

1. Go to your instance in AWS Console
2. Click on the Security Group
3. Edit Inbound Rules
4. Add a new rule:
   - Type: Custom TCP
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (allows access from anywhere)
   - Port: Your container's port number

After configuring the security group, you should be able to access your container through the browser using the public IP address and port.
